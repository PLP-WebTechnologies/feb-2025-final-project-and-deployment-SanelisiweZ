        The South African Provisional First Home Finance Subsidy is a government initiative to assist first-time homebuyers with affordable financing options. This subsidy helps reduce monthly repayments by providing a financial boost during the initial home purchase.

        The subsidy targets low to middle-income earners and is part of a larger effort to promote home ownership and reduce the housing backlog. It applies to newly built homes, resale homes, and certain government-approved housing schemes.
